						<h6>To Our Wedding Site</h6>
						<p>
							For those of you who will not be able to make it to our wedding, we thought this would be a great way for us to share all of our experience with you. For all of you who will be attending, all of the information you could ever want to know about us and our wedding will be available for you here.
							​After just shy of four wonderful years together, Josh and I are ecstatic that we'll be able to share our love with our friends and family at Barn on Jackson in Chehalis, WA. The venue is absolutely gorgeous and we cannot wait for you to see it. We know it is quite the trek to Chehalis but we hope it does not discourage you to make the trip! Please see the Event Information page for further details.
							We are looking forward to seeing everyone on the BIG DAY! Thank you to all of our friends and family for supporting us and loving us over the years. Feel free to message us with any questions you may have and check back often as we will be making frequent updates to the website as the plans progress.
							​<br>love, josh&belinda
